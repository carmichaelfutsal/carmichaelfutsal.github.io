<p>Futsal is a small side game with only 5 players on the field for each team at a time. Due to the low ratio of players to ball, each player has many more touches on the ball than outdoor or traditional indoor soccer. Using a small court (in our case a basketball court) constrains game play and requires players to control the ball to be successful. All these touches add up: players will progress rapidly with ball control and precise movements.  With such a small field of play, many scoring opportunities will be had; making for a fun and rewarding experience for all!</p>

<p>Carmichael futsal coaches should get comfortable with the fact that the game-play itself will teach the kids. Coaches need to help the kids understand the basics of game-play (e.g. out bounds requires a kick-in to restart play), and to substitute tired players off the field (done on the fly). Other than that- coaches: sit back and enjoy! Allow the game to be the teacher!</p>

<p>Why Futsal? In a word: repetition. No lines, no waiting, everyone is involved: futsal provides many opportunities for players to learn from the game. Other benefits of futsal: improved coordination, increased technical abilities (dribbling, passing, shooting, ball control), increased understanding of game-play, problem solving, physical fitness,  competition, fun, enjoyment, and much more!</p>

<p>The primary focus for youth players is the development of technical skills like dribbling, and kicking. Futsal is an ideal tool for developing these skills and encourages experimentation to find their own way to execute technical skill!  Futsal is credited for what makes Brazil , Spain and other powerhouse countries such amazing factories for churning out world class soccer talent- as it is an integral part of their training program for developing players.</p>

<p>How many players should you have on your team? There are 5 on the court at a time, you will need at least a couple subs as futsal is a physically taxing game. Depending on how consistent your kids are available for games you will want 7 up to 10 kids on your team. If you need a couple more kids for your team, please let us know, we can help to complete your roster.</p>

<p>What kind of kids should you draw from?  Any and all kids  that have an interest  in playing - we will do our best to match up skill levels to  ensure everyone has a chance to succeed.</p>

<p>Equipment: players need flat, rubber-soled shoes; not cleats! Basketball, tennis, flat soled indoor soccer shoes are appropriate. Shin guards, long socks to cover them, and shorts are all needed to play. Goalkeepers may choose to wear pants and/or knee-pads.</p>
