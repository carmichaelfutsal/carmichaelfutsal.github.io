<p>Futsal is a small side game (5 on the field) on a small field. Constrained game play and fewer players, gives each player lots of touches under constant pressure and requires players to control the ball to be successful. All these touches add up: players will progress rapidly with ball control and precise movements.</p>

<p>Carmichael Futsal coaches should get comfortable with the fact that the game-play itself will teach the kids. Coaches need to help the kids understand the basics (e.g. out bounds requires a kick-in), and to substitute tired players off the field (done on the fly). Other than that- coaches: sit back and enjoy!</p>

<p>Why Futsal? In a word: repetition. No lines, no waiting, everyone is involved: futsal provides many opportunities for players to learn from the game.</p>

<p>The primary focus for youth players is the development of technical skills like dribbling, and kicking. Futsal is an ideal tool for developing these skills and encourages experimentation to find their own way to execute technical skill!  Futsal is an integral part of world soccer power's (e.g. Brazil, Spain, etc.) training programs for developing players- and is said to be a key part of their success.</p>

<p>How many players should you have on your team? There are 5 on the court at a time, you will need at least a couple subs as futsal is a physically taxing game. Depending on how consistent your kids are available for games you will want 7 up to 10 kids on your team. If you need a couple more kids for your team, please let us know, we can help to complete your roster.</p>

<p>What kind of kids should you draw from?  Any and all kids  that have an interest  in playing - we will do our best to match up skill levels to ensure everyone has a chance to succeed.</p>
