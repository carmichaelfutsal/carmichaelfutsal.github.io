<p>Futsal is a small sided soccer game with only 5 players on the field for each team at a time. Because of the low ratio of players to ball, each player has many more touches on the ball than outdoor or traditional indoor soccer. Using a basketball court constrains game play and requires players to control the ball to be successful. All these touches add up: players will progress rapidly with ball control and precise movements. With such a small field of play, many scoring opportunities will be had; making for a fun and rewarding experience for all!</p>

<p>The origin of Futsal (Five-a-Side Soccer) can be traced back to Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1930 when Juan Carlos Ceriani devised a five-a-side version of soccer for youth competition in YMCAs. Futsal is now played in all continents of the world by over 100 countries with 12 million players.</p>
