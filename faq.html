<h3>Why futsal?</h3>

<p>Futsal is a skill-oriented game that encourages quick thinking and technique. Because of the small field, and low players to ball ratio futsal encourages rapid skill development that transfer to outdoor soccer.</p>

<h3>How much will it cost?</h3>

<p>Fees are kept as low as possible to operate the league. Team registration will be $325 per youth team + each player needs to sign up for annual insurance with US Futsal for $10. Each coach needs to sign up for $20/year with US Futsal for coverage.  See Registration for more information.</p>

<h3>How many games are there?</h3>

<p>Each season will have 8 games.</p>
