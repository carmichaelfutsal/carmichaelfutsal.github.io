<p>The origin of Futsal (Five-a-Side Soccer) can be traced back to Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1930 when Juan Carlos Ceriani devised a five-a-side version of soccer for youth competition in YMCAs. Futsal is now played in all continents of the world by over 100 countries with 12 million players.</p>

<p><strong>Why futsal?</strong><br>Futsal is a skill-oriented game that encourages quick thinking and technique. Because of the small field, and low players to ball ratio futsal encourages rapid skill development that transfer to outdoor soccer.</p>

<p><strong>How much will it cost?</strong><br>Fees are kept as low as possible to operate the league. Team registration will be $325 per youth team + each player needs to sign up for annual insurance with US Futsal for $10. Each coach needs to sign up for $20/year with US Futsal for coverage.  See Registration for more information.</p>

<p><strong>How many games are there?</strong><br>Each season will have 8 games.</p>

<p><strong>What equipment is needed for futsal?</strong><br>Team shirts all the same color, shorts (only the goalkeeper may wear pants), shin guards covered by socks, and futsal appropriate footwear. Goalkeepers may choose to wear pants and/or kneepads.</p>

<p><strong>What is futsal appropriate footwear?</strong><br>Flat-soled, non-marking shoes. The following will work: futsal shoes, indoor soccer (flat-soled) shoes, tennis sneakers, running shoes, and basketball shoes. What comes in on your shoes- ends up on our game courts!</p>

<p><strong>How do I sign my team up for your league?</strong><br>Your coach needs to fill out a team registration form first.  After turning in the team registration form, you will get further instructions for the next stage of the registration process.</p>

<p><strong>Can individual players sign up for leagues, too?</strong><br>Yes- we will do our best to match up interested individuals with appropriate teams- please email us if you need a team (<a href="mailto:carmichaelfutsal@gmail.com">carmichaelfutsal@gmail.com</a>).</p>

<p><strong>How many players are on a 5v5 futsal team roster?</strong><br>Minimum 5, but we recommend at least 7 up to a maximum of 12.</p>

<p><strong>When do league schedules come out?</strong><br>The schedule for the first week of a league will generally come out about 5 days before the first day of games. The schedule for the rest of the season will come out a day (or two) after the first day of games. We do it this way in an effort to create the most competitive divisions and match-ups.</p>

<strong>What size ball will we play with?</strong><br>
<ul>
	<li>U12 and under - size 3 or a Select "Jinga"</li>
	<li>U13 and older - size 4 FUTSAL ball</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How is a futsal ball different than an outdoor soccer ball?</strong><br>Futsal balls are less bouncy, making them easier to control on a hard surface.</p>

<p><strong>What age groups will the Carmichael Futsal League cater to?</strong><br>Our inital focus will be youth teams. We will have as many youth age groups (e.g. u8, u10, etc.) as we have adequate teams sign up for. We will introduce adult league play soon- stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>Does my team need a coach?</strong><br>Yes, coaches are mandatory - no licenses are required</p>

<p><strong>I don't know anything about futsal, but I am signed up to be a futsal coach! Help!</strong><br>Don't worry! Let the game teach the player! You need to know the basics of game play, and sub tired players off, other than that- sit back and enjoy! We will offer an introductory clinic before the season to orient players and coaches to the sport and rules.</p>

<p><strong>When do games start?</strong><br>The first Carmichael Futsal season will start in mid January through March. We are working with Carmichael Parks and Recretion District to offer introductory clinics before the season to orient players and coaches to the sport and rules. Games will be once a week.</p>
