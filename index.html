<p>Coming in winter 2015, we will start our inaugural season of futsal in Carmichael California!</p>

<p>Futsal is a quick-paced, small-sided game played on a small field of play- in our case on a basketball court. It is a sport played by millions all over the world as it is fun to play and fun to watch! Futsal is recognized as a fantastic way to develop soccer skills.</p>

<p>We have partnered with Carmichael Parks and Recreation, to hold games at the La Sierra Community Center gyms.</p>
